# TypeScript DApp Template

This is app was bootstrated using TypeScript template for Cartesi DApps. It uses node to execute the backend application.
The application entrypoint is the `src/index.ts` file. It is bundled with [esbuild](https://esbuild.github.io), but any bundler can be used.

# Interface:
For now, there is no personalized and customized front-end other than the friendly  Cartesi Explorer interface located at http://localhost:8080/explorer when the command `cartesi run` is executed on the command line.
